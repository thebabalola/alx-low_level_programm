#C - Debugging
#TASKS

Multiple mains: In most projects, only one main file is provided for testing. For example, this main file tests a postitive_or_negative() function, which is similar to one you've encountered in a previous C project.

Task: Make a copy of this main file. Your objective is to comment out (without deleting) the part of the code causing an infinite loop in the output. Do not add or remove lines of code; we will check the line count. Your only action should be commenting out existing code. Compiling with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic is not necessary for this task.

0 > 972?: This program is a mandatory task that prints the largest of three integers.

Leap year: Another mandatory task, this program converts a date to the day of the year and calculates the remaining days in the year, accounting for leap years.
