Debugging is the practice of identifying and resolving defects or issues that disrupt the proper operation of a computer program, software, or system. Debugging techniques encompass interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit and integration testing, log file analysis, application and system-level monitoring, memory dumps, and profiling.

Project Details
This project, undertaken as part of the Full Stack Software Engineering program at ALX, is focused on enhancing debugging proficiency within the C programming language.

Technology Stack
The C files in this project are compiled using gcc 4.8.4 and adhere to the C90 standard. Testing was conducted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

File Summary
The project comprises several C programs, each serving a specific purpose:

1. `0-main.c`: Verifies the correctness of the `positive_or_negative()` function when handling cases involving 0.
2. `1-main.c`: Corrects a program that previously caused an infinite loop.
3. `2-largest_number.c`: Identifies and prints the largest integer from three provided values.
4. `3-print_remaining_days.c`: Converts a date to the day of the year and calculates the remaining days in the year.
5. `holberton.h`: A header file.

The primary goal of the project is to sharpen debugging skills and assess the provided functions across various scenarios.
